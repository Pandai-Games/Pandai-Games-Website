# 🐙 GitHub Repository Setup Guide

Follow these steps to publish your Pandai Games website to GitHub:

## 🚀 Quick Setup (GitHub Web Interface)

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right → "New repository"
3. Fill out the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `pandai-games-webpage`
   - **Description**: `Modern gaming platform with glassmorphism design and email notifications`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
4. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub
Copy the commands from GitHub's "push an existing repository" section and run them:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pandai-games-webpage.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 📋 Manual Setup Steps

If you prefer to do it step by step:

### 1. Add Remote Origin
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pandai-games-webpage.git
```

### 2. Rename Branch to Main (if needed)
```bash
git branch -M main
```

### 3. Push to GitHub
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔧 Repository Configuration

### Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)
If you want to host the static client on GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your repository → Settings → Pages
2. Source: Deploy from a branch
3. Branch: `main`
4. Folder: `/client/dist` (after building)

### Set Up Branch Protection (Recommended)
1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch
3. Enable:
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Restrict pushes to branch

### Configure Repository Settings
1. **About section**: Add description and topics like:
   - `react`
   - `nodejs`
   - `express`
   - `gaming`
   - `glassmorphism`
   - `fullstack`
   - `web-development`

2. **Features**: Enable/disable as needed:
   - ✅ Issues
   - ✅ Projects
   - ✅ Wiki (optional)
   - ✅ Discussions (optional)

## 📂 Repository Structure After Upload

├── README.md                   # Project documentation
└── package.json               # Workspace configuration
```

## 🚀 Automatic Deployment Setup

The included GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) will:
- ✅ Run on every push to `main`
- ✅ Test builds with Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- ✅ Build the production client
- ✅ Upload build artifacts

### To enable automatic deployment:
1. Add deployment steps to the workflow file
2. Set up environment secrets in repository settings
3. Configure your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

## 🔑 Environment Variables

For production deployment, set these in your hosting platform:
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
```

## 📝 Next Steps After GitHub Setup

1. **Add collaborators** if working with a team
2. **Set up issue templates** for bug reports and features
3. **Configure automated deployments** to your hosting platform
4. **Add status badges** to README (build status, deployment status)
5. **Set up monitoring** and analytics

## 🏷️ Creating Releases

When ready to create releases:
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release - Pandai Games website"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Then create a release on GitHub with release notes.

## 🎯 Repository Best Practices

- ✅ Write descriptive commit messages
- ✅ Use meaningful branch names for features
- ✅ Keep the main branch stable
- ✅ Review pull requests before merging
- ✅ Tag releases with semantic versioning
- ✅ Update documentation regularly

Your Pandai Games website is now ready for GitHub! 🎉
